This is an R package that combines Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis
and geospatial techniques to visualize a spatial fishing pressure index (FPI) 
for vessels that are not equipped with monitoring devices. 
The outcomes of FPI are combined with table G (effort by country)
and table a (landings) to estimate spatial fishing effort, landings weight and value of landings.
