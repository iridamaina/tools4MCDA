This is an R package that combines Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis
and geospatial techniques to visualize a spatial fishing pressure index (FPI) 
for vessels that are not equipped with monitoring devices. 
The outcomes of FPI are combined with tables from the Fisheries Dependent Information (FDI) to estimate spatial fishing effort, landings weight and value of landings.
The tables from FDI that are used in the procedure are the table G (effort by country)
and the table A (landings).
